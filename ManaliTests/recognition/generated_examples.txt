I’m struggling to understand this part of the codebase. How do you approach reading unfamiliar code? Start by looking at the high-level structure and how the pieces fit together. Don’t focus too much on individual functions right away.
Why do we use middleware in Express.js? Middleware lets us run functions during the request-response cycle. It’s great for handling authentication, logging, or even error-handling before sending a response.
I keep forgetting to commit my changes in Git. Any advice? Try committing small, frequent changes rather than large chunks. Also, using a tool like Git hooks can remind you to commit regularly.
I don’t really understand how to handle API rate limits. What’s the strategy? When you hit rate limits, you can implement retries with exponential backoff or cache results locally to reduce the number of requests.
What’s the purpose of refactoring code if it already works? Refactoring makes code cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain without changing its functionality. It reduces the chance of bugs and makes future updates easier.
How do you decide what goes into a class versus a function? Classes are great for grouping related data and behavior, while functions are typically used for tasks or operations that don’t need to maintain state.
I’ve heard about Agile, but how do we actually use it on a project? Agile focuses on small, iterative development cycles. We can use sprints to plan, build, and review in short increments to adapt quickly to changes.
I don’t understand why we’re using TypeScript. Isn’t JavaScript enough? TypeScript adds static typing, which helps catch errors early during development and makes your code more predictable and easier to refactor.
How can I make my functions more readable? Start by giving them meaningful names and limiting their scope to a single responsibility. Also, break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions.
What’s the difference between refactoring and rewriting code? Refactoring improves existing code without changing its behavior. Rewriting means starting from scratch, which can introduce new bugs if not carefully planned.
How do you usually debug issues in production? I start by checking logs and using monitoring tools to track down errors. If needed, I’ll reproduce the issue locally with the same data or environment.
I’m unsure how to handle large files in this app. What’s the best approach? You can use file streaming or chunking to handle large files efficiently without loading them all into memory at once.

How do I improve the readability of this nested loop? Try breaking it down into separate functions or using more descriptive variable names. You can also use array methods like map or filter for cleaner code.
I’m confused about how dependency injection works. Can you explain? Dependency injection provides a way to supply the objects a class needs rather than creating them inside the class itself. It makes the code more testable and flexible.
I don’t know how to handle optional parameters in this function. What’s the best approach? You can use default values in your function definition, or you can pass an options object that can be expanded with new parameters later.
Why are we writing tests before building the feature? Writing tests first helps define what the feature should do, so we’re clear on the requirements. It also ensures we’re building something testable from the start.
How do I avoid duplicating code in multiple files? Consider abstracting the common logic into a utility function or module that you can import wherever needed.
I’m struggling to understand how to handle state in React. Any advice? Start with local state using useState, but when you need to share state across components, look into useContext or a state management library like Redux.
Why are we using environment-specific configurations? It helps manage differences between local development, staging, and production environments without changing the actual code.
I’m not sure how to handle form validation. What’s the best practice? Use client-side validation for immediate feedback, but always validate on the server as well for security and data integrity.
